Sculptures containing unique images created using a MATLAB program that generates figures using a given set of rules and random numbers. The creation of these images utilizes both order and randomness in the process of creation to create families of related images. The pieces involve the role of computation as a tool for direct or indirect creation and the exploration of what is authored and what is not, of what is fabricated and what is natural.
