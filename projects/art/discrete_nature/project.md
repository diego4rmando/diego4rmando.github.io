In these works, a series of unique images were created using a MATLAB program that generates figures using a given set of rules and random numbers. Every time the program is run, a new image is generated. The creation of these images comments on the necessity of both order and randomness in the process of creation by either a purposeful actor as a human or by nature itself. The pieces also involve the role of computation as a tool for direct or indirect creation and the exploration of what is authored and what is not, of what is fabricated and what is natural.
