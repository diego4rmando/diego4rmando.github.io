In this series, multiple pieces are created as manifestations of the same pattern defined by a simple mathematical framework that generates complexity from the inherent qualities of integer numbers. Multiple types of artworks including computer-drawn images, sculptures, and music are created using a defined counting pattern. The visual, physical and auditory results have common qualities, and reveal concepts of number theory in different ways.

In Gradient, repeating patterns can be found at rates consistent with the least common multiple of the row numbers. These same rates can also be found in Towers in which tower height patterns repeat, and in Note Scale, note patterns repeat at set rates for the duration of the piece. When installed, the pieces collectively span one pattern loop which transitions from one medium to the next.
