The Dune Bot was developed in the Cornell Cup Lab as a non-holonomic modular robotics platform which would enable various research teams to adapt its capabilities as a robust vehicle with other added functionality for uses such as outdoor data collection or even game play in a human-robot game of laser tag.

I worked on this project in the Fall of 2012 and became the Mechanical Engineering team lead in the Spring of 2013. I worked with team mates on the high-level design of the system and integration of the various components as well as performing critical analyses of the design feasibility and helped manufacture and assemble the system. The robot was showcased at the 2013 Cornell Cup at Disney World.
